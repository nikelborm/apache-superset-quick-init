cd ./superset
# for passwords you can use for example `openssl rand -base64 48`
# passwords auto-generated by ./main.sh, and you don't need to generate them
# if you need to edit some unusual vars, uncomment and edit them here
# nano ./docker/.env
# nano ./docker/superset-websocket/config.json

# choose tag you want: 'latest' or something specific like '4.1.1'
# here are examples of tags:
# https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/docker-builds/#key-tags-examples
# https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
# https://github.com/apache/superset/releases

export TAG='latest'
# if use chose latest, good idea to always pull
# docker compose up -d --pull always
docker compose up -d
# follow logs until completely deployed
docker compose logs -f
```

## TODO

1. create separate script for quick registering of a new database into current superset instance
